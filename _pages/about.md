I am a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies, supervised by Prof. Angela P. Schoellig. My research focuses on state estimation, with the overarching goal of enabling robots to operate reliably in challenging environments by fusing complementary information from radio, inertial, and ego-motion sensors.

I enjoy designing and building robotic systems from the ground up, working across the full autonomy stack—from state estimation to planning and control.

On this site, I share insights and lessons from the projects I’ve worked on (and continue to work on), in the hope that they might be helpful to others.
